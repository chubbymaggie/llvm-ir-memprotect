= Ad-hoc test framework inspired by llvm testsuite =

== Running tests ==

./run_tests.sh [<test_file.(c|ll)>]

If test_file is not given, runner finds all tests from current directory and runs them.

== Writing new tests ==

All test file names must be either:

test_*.c

or

test_*.ll

Each test file has execution instructions in the test file's comments. 

For C code test comment can be e.g. 

// RUN: clang -O3 $TEST_SRC -c -o -emit-llvm $OUT_FILE.bc && 
// RUN: opt -load $CLAMP_PLUGIN -clamp-pointers $OUT_FILE.bc -S -o $OUT_FILE.clamped.ll &&
// RUN: grep "this must be found" $OUT_FILE.camped.ll

Before running tests CLAMP_PLUGIN variable must be set.

Variables that can be used in tests are:

CLAMP_PLUGIN Absolute path to clamp_pointers plugin module
TEST_SRC Source file of the test
OUT_FILE File name which points to run_temp directory to prevent trashing test directory
